This package aims to collate cross reference data pertaining to the
functions exported by various versions of the MSVCRT runtime library,
versus the particular versions of that library in which each function
appears.  The data tabulated in the working document has been obtained
by running MinGW.org's pexports tool on various versions of MSVCRT.DLL
and MSVCRxx.DLL to which I have been able to acquire access, or which
other contributors have provided in pexports symbol listing format.

To compile the final PDF document from the provided source, you will
require working GCC, GhostScript, and GNU Troff installations, within
a shell environment which supports interpretation of Bourne shell
scripts and GNU compatible makefiles.
